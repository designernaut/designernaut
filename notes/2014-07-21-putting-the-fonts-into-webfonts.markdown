## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2014


### Jonathan Hoefler - [@HoeflerCo]


#### Why we design typefaces

It's not just about nice letters and numbers.

It solves problems.

- You can do more
- Encourages reading
- Saves time
- Conserve resources

#### Solve Problems of the Web

**Clarity**

[cloud.typography](http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/)

Changes to weight, angle, etc. to make the font *for* the web.

Multipurpose Fonts and ScreenSmart Fonts

Fonts for the screen do differ from their print versions, but who cares. One is for print and one is for web and they both look nice.

<br>
**Family**

- Not enough weights
- Indistinct weights
- Disordered weights
<br>

Typography is in the details. Fonts on the web have a bright future.
