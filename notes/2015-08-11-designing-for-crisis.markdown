## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2015


### Eric Meyer - [@meyerweb]

We like to think of our audience as someone we see in stock photos: calm, happy, sititng in their nice home, enjoying life.

Add the 'person in crisis' to your user personas.

Have empathy for your audience. Not simply 'being nice' but 'fully imagining being a person who doesn't kow how this works'.

If you improve the experience for a person in crisis, you'll improve it for everyone.

Some ideas for usability testing:

- Blur the page in and out to simulate an experience of struggling to focus.
- Remove elements
- Swap words around
- Give an extreme time constraints
