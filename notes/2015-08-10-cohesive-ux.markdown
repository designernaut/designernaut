## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2015


### Cameron Moll - [@cameronmoll]

- Responsive Web Design
- Elective UX
- Cohesive UX


#### RWD
Roughly 50% of multi-screen users email themselves a link for continuing an activity on another device.

Does my site’s responsive mobile version disable pinch & zoom?


#### Elective UX
Pixel-perfect, fixed-width design is dead (expect for apps, for some reason).

Linear sites are fine for focus and concentration, but what about scanning, wayfinding, and context?

Gesture-enabled RWD


#### Cohesive UX
Let's make it work everywhere!

“We understood mobile just to be another screen.” - JOHN DONAHOE

Mobile (noun) vs. Mobile (verb)

Cohesion (noun) - forming a united whole


#### Unified UX
1. Form *and* Function
2. Data Symmetry

We need to do more to make our experiences unified across devices.

Make the mobile site and mobile app work and look the same.

The best interface is the one within reach.

#### Five Suggestions
1. Inventory all elements that comprise.
    - Tone, Iconography, Typography, User preferences, Color, Etc.
2. Store session data in the cloud, rather than locally.
3. Consider using web views when developing your native app.
    - “You’re already using web apps in native wrappers without even noticing it…. Web vs. native doesn’t matter anymore" - Mike Matas
4. Replace 'click' with tap or press, and 'mobile' with mobile-ish (or michael or whatever).
5. Respect (existing) mental models.
