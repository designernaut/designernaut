    I stumbled upon an internal ask for a simple tool that would allow a person to type in their password and find out if it was any good or not. I decided to take it on as a little side project and developed it in an evening.

    I wanted to make this really simple with no instructions needed. You should be able to land on the page and immediately understand what you need to do and what the information is telling you. With this in mind, I went very minimal with the design and let the circle graph and results do the talking.

    I didn't want to try to figure out how to write the backend logic that powers this little tool. There's some complex math involved in how long it would take a computer to crack a password. I was resourceful and found an open source project that does this and dropped my design on top of that. In addition, it includes a database of the 10,000 most common passwords, gathered from recent data breaches.

    A future improvement I would like to make will be to allow the user to generate a strong password as well.
