    The one property that I have been most engaged with over the last few years is the EZShield dashboard. EZShield is a large player in the identity and fraud protection space and this dashboard is how our users manage their personally identifiable information. However, after years of development, we were running into a number of issues. Visually, it had aged and not as gracefully as I would like. It had become overly complex from the numerous new services and features added over time. It had no responsive styling, so we were missing out on a subset of our users who were getting a very poor mobile experience. And last, but certainly not least, performance had taken a very serious hit.

    We took everything into consideration and nothing was off limits. One of the major complaints we heard often was that after logging in, users didn't know what they should do first. When everything was calling for attention it was just noise instead of a useful experience. There was just way too much going on. We had fallen into the tendency to over-explain and over-design every feature on the dashboard. I wanted this next iteration to be very clean, dare I say minimal, and really highlight the information are users expected to find quickly. So, we toned it down and gave the dashboard a focus.

    An intential side effect of all of this was the huge boost in performance. So much of the old interface was made up of images that could long be accomplished in CSS. We stripped that all away and let the browser handle rendering the UI. This, amongst other tasks we undertook, resulted in a 96% decrease in page load time!
