    <p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">My name is Michael Ellis. I live in Pennsylvania, USA with my lovely wife, Stephanie, and the greatest dog I have ever met, Waldo. They're both rock solid awesome and provide all the excitement in my life that I need. Otherwise, I am pretty boring. I try to come off as cool though.
    </p>

    <p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">I have been passionate about web design and development ever since I made my first site 15 years ago. It's a constantly evolving industry and has only grown more complex over the years. I love learning all I can about the process.
    </p>

    <p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">I spend a significant amount of my non-working hours reading and learning about topics from design and development, to leadership and business, to psychology and people. My work touches all of these areas and I'm intensely focused on increasing my knowledge in all of them.
    </p>

    <p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">I care about working on a team that is as dedicated and passionate as I am. I enjoy sharing what I am learning with others with the hope that it improves the collective output of us all. I believe in helping others to be better at their job. I care about their development as much as my own. I don't believe others have to lose in order for me to win.
