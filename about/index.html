    <p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">My name is Michael Ellis. I live in Pennsylvania, USA with my lovely wife, Stephanie, and the greatest dog I have ever met, Waldo. They're both rock solid awesome and provide all the excitement in my life that I need. Otherwise, I am pretty boring. I try to come off as cool though.
    </p>

    <p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">I have been intrigued by the web since 2001, when I started learning what it takes to build a website. I could go on and on about why the web is amazing but I expect if you've found your way to my site, you already know that. The opportunities are endless and that gives me just enough room to mess around and make a living.

    <p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">I work full time as a web designer at EZShield, a unique company that's trying to tackle this problem of identity theft and fraud. With the rise of the internet as a powerful tool for good around the world, comes the flipside where lives can be ruined in a minute by someone on the other side of the world by stealing and using their identities. I personally spend the majority of my time designing and developing our web platform that our customers can interact with to keep track of and protect their identities. It's a big challenge, but it's a bigger opportunity. The chance at serving someone else and possibly saving them a lot of stress and frustration feels great.
    </p>

    <p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">When I'm not there, I am likely right here working on this site, interacting on twitter or dribbble, or trying to learn something new. I want to make this world better and do my part. I'm not sure about making a dent in the universe, but if I can make a difference in your life that probably would mean more. So please feel free to reach out and connect with me. If I can help you out in any way, I'd love to.
