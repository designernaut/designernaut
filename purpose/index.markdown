The purpose of this site is simple &ndash; to be of some help to you and to myself. I have never hidden the fact that I want to learn and to grow and having your own site that you must maintain and improve is a great way to do so. I only hope that in that same regard you too may get something out of this. To be honest, I hope you get more out of these pages than I do. I believe it will be far more valuable to us all if that is the case.

I intend to share my thoughts and my works with open arms and an open mind. I'm old enough to believe I know what I am talking about but young enough to realize there is a wealth of wonder out there where I am helplessly lost. I can only hope to shorten that list.
