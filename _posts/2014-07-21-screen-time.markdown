## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2014


### Luke Wroblewski - [@lukew]


The screen is the window to the software & the internet

Online time is **screen time**.

Not all screens are built equally.

#### 1. Know Your *Increasingly Mobile* Screen

The future of our screens are not the traditional pc desktops. The future is in the mobile/tablet realm.

The opportunity for the mobile form factor is staggering.

#### 2. Output

- Use CSS & web type whenever possible
- use SVG & icon fonts whenever applicable
- Picturefill raster graphics

Look at using vertical media queries to dictate layout and design elements based on vertical space.

In North America, 50% of downstream traffic is Youtube and Netflix. This is why our devices are more and more moving to widescreen aspect ratios.

#### 3. Input

We live in a multi-input world. Touch, keyboards, pen, trackpad.

Can't we just detect input type & change the interface?
Don't attempt to switch between mouse and touch, just support both.

Coming changes in Media Query Level 4 will help detect touch (mouse, finger, stylus, etc.)

- Support **all** the inputs
- Communicate what's possible
- Screen size is a poor proxy but it's all we got

#### 4. Posture

How people interact with output & input

Changing design choices and sizes based on distance the user is from the device.

Other changes coming in media query will detect light levels and allow you to change design accordingly.

Increasingly the mobile screen is becoming the priority screen.
