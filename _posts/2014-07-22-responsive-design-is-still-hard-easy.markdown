## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2014


### Dan Mall - [@danielmall]

Why do we model our agencies after out-dated models like the assembly line?

#### A Framework (not a process)

Waterfall to Agile in 6 easy steps

1. Passing the Baton - Have a little bit of an overlap between
2. More together time - Some overlap between all departments
3. Maximum Involvement - Complete overlap among all departments
4. Appropriate Tapering - Complete overlap, with heavy involvement in the beginning, but some down time at certain times
5. Focal Points - Kickoff together, then diverge in your thinking and converge together again at the launch point
6. Rinse & Repeat - Start, work, ship. Start, work, ship. Start, work, ship.

A Modern Web Design Process in 4 Steps:

1. Plan
	- Research
	- Hypothesize
2. Inventory
	- Content Inventory
	- Performance Budgets
	- Pattern Inventory ([http://patternlab.io/](http://patternlab.io/))
	- [Visual Inventory](http://danielmall.com/articles/visual-inventory/)

	Content Strategy for Designers
	- Add, Edit, Remove
3. Sketch
	- Content Reference Workflow
		- Linear Design. Just list out everything that needs to be on the page.
	- [Element Collages](http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/)
	- High fidelity that allows you to have the right conversation in the shortest amount of time.
	- We can't just design comps anymore because those are just one moments in time. It's not sustainable.
4. Assemble
	- Presets
	- Have all the pieces ready so all you have to do is assemble.
