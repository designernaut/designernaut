## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2014


### Jeffrey Zeldman - [@zeldman]
<br>
It's really hard to explain what it is that we do and why it matters.

[The Art Directors Club](http://adcglobal.org/) - promotes the very best in design and yearly gives out awards. Jeffrey was invited to judge one year. He wasn't judging websites at all though. He was there to judge commercials on youtube.

"It's interactive if it's on the internet." (is what Jeffrey was told)

The web is viewed as the second-rate stuff that's not good enough for TV. This is worrisome because the web is the best thing ever.

When the people we have appointed to judge the best work doesn't understand or appreciate good web design, our colleagues, clients, and bosses won't either.

It used to be that you worked at a terrible agency that got the jobs because they had no standards. Or you worked for a really good agency that couldn't get the jobs because they held their standards so high that no one could understand.

[The Webby Awards](http://www.webbyawards.com/) and the [.Net Awards](https://thenetawards.com/) actually care about how the sites are made, usability, etc.

The only problem is that these awards don't mean anything to anyone besides other designers. You could bring an armload of them to your boss and it won't hold much weight. Our bosses don't attend things like this ([An Event Apart](http://www.aneventapart.com)).

A lot of companies are advocates for the web, such as Google, Apple, Adobe, etc. But even the best of these can only sell to us, not talk for us.

Facebook approached mobile as a technology problem, when it was really a design problem.


- We don't design for browsers. What we do is for people, so that they have a good experience.
- We don't make our pages accessible, or validate, to get a gold star. We do it for people.
- We don't design for mobile devices, or tablets or desktop. We do it for people.
- Web design is like type design.
- Web design is like architecture.  
<br>

- A great website makes interaction easy.
- Great design is never passive. It only looks that way.
- Great web design can be invisible or in your face.
- Great web design delights.  
<br>

### How to spread the word:

- Represent the profession.
- Don't wait to be asked. Don't be at the end of the food chain.
- Arrive early and often.
- Push yourself in as a volunteer.
- Achieve the right things for the wrong reasons.

We are all evangelists.
