## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2015

### Jeffrey Zeldman - [@zeldman]

The Fault, Dear Brutus (or Career Advice from a Cranky Old Man)


#### Working
"We didn't know how to make a website, so we made a really cool website."

"Everything wrong, we did."


#### Work never sells itself.
No matter how good the design is, if the designer presents the work and asks "what do you think", they'll get a million answers about the wrong color blue or my dog doesn't like the layout, etc.

You remind them what problems you were trying to solve and how this design solves it. You don't talk about the aesthetics.


#### Attitude trumps work in most companies.
(Great work + Bad attitude = Fired)


#### In big companies, politics trumps work.
Get out of your comfort zone and gab a little. Get with the boss and converse more.


#### First impressions are forever.
You can be at a place for 5 years and your boss will still look at you as the junior designer.

If that's the case, you have to change something to get ahead.


#### "We have met the enemy, and he is us"
We have to stop our snobbery from keeping us from succeeding.
I am what stands between me & success.

- Go to meetups.
- Go, observe, sit, watch, and eventually you'll get a little more social and talk.
- Find something that relieves your pressure.
- Meditate, pray.
- Get out of your head.


#### Help! My portfolio smells.
Work may be compromised.
Work may be secret.
Sleight of hand. Share around the problem.

- Talk about the work you did without showing it.
- Talk about what you did improve.
- Talk about the notable work that clients actually care about.


#### Blog like one one's reading.
You don't have to be afraid. Think of it as discussion, not writing.
Publish it or you never will.
Blog when you're pissed off. You'll have something to say.
Writing helps you to understand what you have to say.


#### Don't wait for someone to hand you a dream job or a dream project
