## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2015

#### Social Media
A tool to make *something* happen.

An effective social media campaign is based on the psychology of social behaviors, not current technology.

Typical web project - If [we] build it. They will come.

We are struggling to understand this world (the web) we have found ourselves in.

We're putting far too much weight in egotistical metric numbers (followers, etc.)


#### The basic social ecosystem
Center: Your persona & tone of voice
1. Publishing channels
2. Aspirational/inspirational channels
3. Support channels
4. Follow up channels

Example: Warby Parker

1. Publishing channels
    - website
    - blog
    - tumblr
    - facebook

2. Aspirational/Inspirationals channels
    - instagram
    - facebook
    - twitter
    - pintrest
    - tumblr
    - we heart it

3. Support channels
    - twitter
    - email
    - facebook
    - phones

4. Follow up channels
    - facebook
    - twitter
    - email campaigns


#### Why the general socail approach fails
We don't have enough data to know how to reach people.

You can't just pick the four big social media outlets and post links to that without knowing where your users are.


#### Obama vs. Romney campaigns
In the Romney campaign, 22 people had to approve a single piece of social media content

In the Obama campaign, 6 people (the entire digital team) had to approve a single peice of social media content.

The Obama team was quicker, more authentic, and more effective in reaching their base.


#### Facebook
Younger generation uses Facebook very differently than us. They rarely post to walls but use the messenger like crazy.

"On mobile, each app can only focus on doing one thing well, we think" - Mark Zuckerburg

#### Instagram
Much more curated than we think.

Post frequency has a big part of how many followers you have.

#### Tumblr
Younger generation feels they can be more anonymous there.

They're more than happy to post things there that they wouldn't post on Facebook.

#### Twitter
Sharing and talking with strangers.

Used to be the geeky hangout of web designers.

#### Snapchat
Huge in the younger generation


#### Conversion
A very small fraction of your followers will actually convert on something you post.

With advertising, you don't actually own the follower count you have, they belong to the network you're on.

Find ways to capture value along with those follows (capture email addresses, etc.).


#### Psychology behind social
Superfans have behaviors that are very unique to them.

Created silos for differnet groups.

Asking a community to do something for the mutual benefit of the community as a whole.

Why do people 'like'?

- Allows me to acknowledge seeing something without having to add anything else.

Why do people comment?

- It's participation media. It's throwing a pebble into water and at least causing a ripple, no matter how small.
- It's like sending in fanmail with at least a better chance of receiving a response.
- Very little price, but a much better return on value is possible.
- Tribe behavior
    - "I don't know what exactly this is, but I want to be apart of the group"
    - I want that new Apple product because everyone wants that product.

- Given a week, users of a broken system will learn to love the broken system and then get mad when you change it for the better.
- They will also learn to game the system if possible.
- Brings out the far extremes of reactions. People who absolutely love or hate something will be the most vocal.


#### Commitment and Authenticity
Commitment

- Sticking with it.

Authenticity

- Showing up with content every day, being yourself.
- You need authentic and professional imagery to get the most out of these social media channels.
- You need to drop the act and be human.
- Ignore your follower counts!
- If you use photography that looks too stock-imagy, people won't believe you.
- Use an authentic tone and voice, and be honest with your mistakes and shortcomings.

#### Emotion
Pull at the emotion of your users.


Example: Free People - great example of using different channels, daily.


#### The lightbulb moment
Don't do the safe, expected thing.
Be prepared to have difficult conversations.
Try the weird things.
