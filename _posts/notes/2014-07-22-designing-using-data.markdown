## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2014


### Sarah Parmenter - [@sazzy]

Being a good designer is no longer enough.

We don't have enough people who know why something works.

Instincts are *experiments*. Data is *proof*.

Our jobs have grown more and more complex.

Data driven design has a short learning curve, and we all can do it.

#### Data/Research

Being able to design with research is what will make us continue to be valuable.

Back up decisions. Unless you can say why these are the decisions you're making, you won't be able to convince anyone.

#### Why?

"Get everyone on the same page, not thinking on preference" - [Samantha Warren](https://twitter.com/samanthatoy)

...is *that* part of my job?

**Some data is better than no data at all**

"Start small. Shock and awe. Then grow bigger."

"Nobody has an excuse to make an uninformed decision anymore" - [Federico Holgado](https://twitter.com/fholgado)

#### Intuition

You don't completely ignore your gut.

#### Strategy

Vanity Metric - an ego stoking metric that won't help at all. Lets you believe things are actually better than they are.
- Hits
- Page views
- Total signups (can only go up)
- Number of visits
- Unique visitors
- Likes

Track *people* and their *habits*.

"We don't design for browsers. We design for people." - [Jeffrey Zeldman](https://twitter.com/zeldman)

#### Identity

Identity what it is you want to test or what you need to gather more data on.

- Segmentation
- Targeting

What is the *common link*?

#### Blushbar

Sarah took her experiences with her profession and try something else (experimenting outside of normal work).

Started by looking at the data

Did a beta phase to see if they could sell vouchers based on their design and facebook promotions alone

Established personas
- Ran facebook ads to see who is engaging in your content (facebook insights panel)

Digital Strategy
- Systems for measuring
- Systems for operating

Include a call to action on every single post if you want any response to it.

Didn't pretend what they weren't. If they were busy, they said so. If they were slow, they said so.

Thanks competitors. Killing them with kindness.

Referrer Loyalty - when someone comes from a referral source, they're much more likely to return from that same referral.

#### UX Design

Give umbrellas because it rains often. It's a brilliant offering to someone who forgot their and you would think you were handing them a pile of gold. They rave about this almost as much as the great hair service.

#### Where is Data coming from?

Call to Action
- Changing wording can increase conversion

Visual Media
- Content First
- Investing in professional photography
- First impression is so important
- Keep a bank of real imagery at hand
- If your photos are too polished, it seems like stock photography which in some situations can be a negative

Patterns

Iterative Working
- [CrazyEgg](http://www.crazyegg.com/)
- [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/)
- [Browserstack](http://www.browserstack.com/)

Human Language
- If you can't explain your findings in real language your boss will be unable to understand
