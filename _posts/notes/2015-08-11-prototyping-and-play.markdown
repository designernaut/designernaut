"A tool is just an opportunity with a handle" - Kevin Kelly, Co-founder of WIRED Magazine

#### How We Prototype
Get to code as soon as possible.

A website is not alive until it's in the browser.

##### Start with sketching

##### Then go to Photoshop

##### Get to code as soon as possible

##### Share what you're building
- CodePen
- ForwardHQ
- LocalTunnel

##### Don't hoard the process
Web design is a team sport

"Your website is a manifestion of your organization's problems"


#### Why do you participate?

- Be seen
- Community
- Play

Group Play = Group Flow

Set goals to match skills

Move faster and have more fun


#### Benefits of prototypes in the workplace
Solve arguments

"If a picture is worth a thousand words, a prototype is worth a thousand JIRA tickets."

Wow and impress upper management

- One step closer to production
- Reduces risk

The cost of not shipping? People quit.

#### Potential Problems
1. Too many designers
2. Didn't code soon enough

##### Move faster and have more fun!
