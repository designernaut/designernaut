## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2015


### Cassie McDaniel - [@cassiemc]

"UI is a software layer. From a customer’s perspective, the whole application is nothing but the UI." – Ryan Singer, Basecamp
"The interface is your product. What people see is what you're selling" - Basecamp

#### Interfaces
- Inform
- Persuade
- Connect


#### Inform
Sometims, fancy = intimidating.
It's smarter to make small changes over time than one big overhaul.
Temper the reactions to changes.
A picture, essentially is just a plane surface covered with colors, assembled in a certain order.

Forest:

- Strategy
- Product
- User research
- Metrics
- Team

Trees:

- Layout
- Color
- Typography
- Photography
- Illustration
- Words

"In 1890 Maurice Denis said: ‘It is well to remember that a picture […] is essentially a plane surface covered with colors, assembled in a certain order.’" – Paul Rand, A Designer’s Art

Think of a design like a song. What notes needs to be more quiet and what notes need to be louder?

Small details can make meaningful changes.
Example, "Let's eat, Grandma" vs. "Let's eat grandma"


#### Persuade
Using carefully curated photography, or other elements, to convince you to do something.

Test what your users are more likely to click on.

Don't pull users eyes in multiple directions. Help them to focus.

Immersion (thegrid.com) is just overwhelming.

#### Connect
Don't regurgitate trends without knowing what it's saying.

Be different. Be human.

[The final 10% is 90% of the work]

10% doesn't mean it has to be over the top, but put the care into the craft, however subtle it needs to be.

We get caught up today in having the right tools and setup before we can get started.

Inject something that is a little true, a little bold, into our designs.
