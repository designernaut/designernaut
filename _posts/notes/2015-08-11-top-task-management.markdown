## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2015


Simplicity is more about taking away than about adding and you have to know what to take away.

If you are focused on the customer, than you are empathetic to their experiences.

Being customer centric is a great way to be hated within your organization. It's a great way to get nowhere.

### Continuous Improvement
1. Identify Top Tasks
2. Measure Top Tasks
3. Improve

We need to measure consumption, rather than production.

The enemy of top tasks are the tiny tasks that want to become top tasks.

How do we defend against the onslaught of tiny tasks?

There is often a world view that is drastically different from the world view of the customer.

Stop sayin, "in my opinion." Use the customer to drive the change.

Everyone thinks everyone loves the brand. No one cares about your brand.

Most organizations are disfunctional. They do the exact opposite of what the customer wants.

There is a huge decline in trust in organizations.

Trust has moved from figureheads and companies to friends and those with similar experiences as us.

The customer is not king. The customer is dictator.

If your business model is not founded in what people want to do, then you don't have a business model.

We demand the things we want the customer to do first, and it doesnt' work.

### Sources for Longlist (task list)
1. Organization strategy
2. Existing website
3. Top 50 search (annual: internal, external)
4. Top 50 most visited pages, files (annual)
5. Competitor, peer websites
6. Traditionl / social media
7. Customer feedback, research
8. Stakeholder reviews

Keep the list under 100.

No overlaps.

The list should be complete, not just reflective of your world view.

Know what you really are, not the mystical thing you want to be.

There's something wrong when we're all responsible for the tiny components that results in a failure, but not the results themselves.

### How to test
1. 10 task questions based on top tasks
2. Carefully select 15-18 participants
3. Test remotely for 1 hour
4. Make it as natural as possible

Give them the instructions and then shut up.

Patterns always emerge about how people go about solving a problem.

If you can fix things, you can move the needle.

##### Key Performance Metrics
- Success rate
- Time on task
- Disaster rate

Never stop measuring the core tasks.

Determine what really matters to your customer and then isolate tasks that reprsent those things and continuously test and improve those metrics.
