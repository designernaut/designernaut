## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2015


### Jen Simmons - [@jensimmons]

We're in a rut with our layouts. It doesn't matter if it's a large respectable news organization or a small local blog.

The new page is these separate panes we're building on single page sites.

#### The medium shapes the medium
There's a world of Graphic Design older than the web.

The default assumption when you go to design a web is to use this default layout. Header on top, side bar running down the side of main content, and footer block on bottom.

#### Layout should serve the content
Magazines have really dynamic layouts that fit the content.

#### CSS Shapes
Wrap content around images.

#### CSS Exclusions

#### Transform: rotate;

#### Multi-column layout

#### CSS Regions
Define content buckets and flow between those buckets

#### Viewport Units
vh (viewport height)

- Measurement in relation to the viewport
- 100vh = 100% of the viewport height

vw
vmin
vmax

#### Flexbox
Ability to center vertically, among other layouts, now possible.

#### CSS Grid Layout

#### Old school floats
Dynamic grids


The hardest part is changing our thinking, not our CSS.
The web is not print. Translate, don't transfer.

Truncation is not a content strategy.

The most dangerous phrase in the language is ‘We’ve always done it this way.’ — Grace Hopper
