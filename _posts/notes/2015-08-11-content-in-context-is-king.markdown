## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2015


### Derek Featherstone - [@feather]

Context is often seen as a device thing.

#### What defines contenxt?
- Time
- Location
- Proximity
- Device
- State of Mind
- Capabilities
- Activity
- Interests
- Interaction

It's not about the device.

Context Map - content priority over time

- Map the different content in relation to importance vs time.
- Content priority changes with respect to time.

Use context to create a more sensible default.

Content priority changes with respect to time

- If the date or time reflects something meaningful to the user, change the prominent content to that which the user would most likely need at that time.

Content priority changes with respect to location

- If the user is within a certain distance of something, the content they need may change.

Content priority changes with respect to proximity

- Content changes based on distance between two users.

Content priority changes with respect to capabilities

- If the device is capable or incapable of something, change content accordingly.

Content priority changes with respect to activity

- If we know what the user's activity is, content changes to match that user's needs.

Content priority changes with respect to interests

- If the user has an option to sort data, allow the content to change to match those interests (i.e. on a flight search results lists, if the user has selected an option to sort by shortest flight, don't hide the flight time in the results as you would if it was sorting by price. Make the flight time prominent.

Content priority changes with respect to state of mind

- Encouraging and discouraging behavior at certain points based on mindset.

All saved context must be resettable. People have to be able to get out.

#### Minimum Viable Interaction
The smallest amount of information and functionality needed to complete an interaction.

Could we design systems and content that works for someone:

- So they don’t need to take their phone out of
their pocket?
- So they don’t need to unlock their phone?
- So they don’t need to open the email?
