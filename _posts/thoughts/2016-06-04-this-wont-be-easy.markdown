The web is changing and yet I don't think we understand just how much it is changing. Both how we develop but also why and for whom. The web looks different to me today than it did just two years ago.
</p>
<p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">
It's hard to see change when you're in the middle of it but we can't lose sight of reality. The reality is that on the scale of history the web is still in its infancy. It's too young to have hard rules.
</p>
<p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">
I spend a lot of my time doing one of three things:
</p>
<p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">
1. learning how to build for the current web
2. actually designing and coding
3. interacting with others who want me to build something for them
</p>
<p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">
This is important to explain because how I view web development has changed. If you're not engaged it's difficult to grasp just what it takes to make something today.
</p>
<p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">
I've heard, all too often, someone say, "I think we can do this pretty easily." Or even better, "I think we can quickly come up with an intuitive flow for the user."
</p>
<p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">
I've been the one to say something along these lines in the past. I don't anymore because there is zero truth to it and it's a dangerous mindset to have. It completely discounts the work needed.
</p>
<p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">
Let me give an example. In the past I was looking at the checkout process on a site I worked on. The existing checkout process was poor. Visually, it was outdated and had little alignment. As a flow, it had none. It would throw errors that could have been avoided. The messaging was unhelpful and didn't display in obvious places. So, all-in-all, it needed some love.
</p>
<p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">
Now, I really wanted to work on this and make improvements. So, I did what any enthusiastic designer/developer looking to impress would do. I found three or four beautiful looking checkout flows from other sites and mocked up a redesign. That was the extent of my research. I shared that with the key decision makers and asked that we do this on the basis that it would be pretty easy.
</p>
<p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">
I had no idea how to do proper validation, or limit user frustrations, I just pitched a prettier picture. I didn't think it would take long and estimated just a few days of work. The end result was time ran out and it sat half-baked. A complete waste.
</p>
<p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">
I underestimated what it would take to make a real improvement because I thought it would be simple.
</p>
<p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">
We often look at the desired outcome and imagine the process to get there is going to be straightforward and painless. Yet, no process for anything we have ever done before has ever gone this way. It's ugly and messy. There must be research and planning and experimentation. You can't just slap something together in you spare time because you think it's a step better and be done with it. That's just a recipe for mediocrity in my view.
</p>
<p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">
I'm done with thinking something is going to be easy. Unless the ask is to change a single word in a block of content, it's not going to be easy. And if I think it is, I'm missing something.
</p>
<p class="center f4 f3-ns mw6 mw7-ns ph3 ph5-ns measure lh-copy">
I encourage you to take a moment to think broader. The work is rarely as narrow as it first seems.
