## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2014


### Jaimee Newberry - [@jaimeejaimee]

Not measuring engagement

"Finding out who your customers are is only half the question. **You also have to understand who you are**." - Aaronn Walter, [Designing for Emotion](http://www.abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion)

Three things to think about:
Attention. Affection. Devotion.

1. Personality
	- What celebrity would your products be?
	- Informs everything

2. Onboarding
	- Introduce the concept
	- Be mindful
		- Don't introduce too much information (i.e. help overlay) right up front.
		- Don't trap users. Don't force them to do something before they can do what they wanted.
		- Give users an escape to quickly get to what they want.
	- Define your objectives
	- Empathy rules!
		- Not only attract users, but gain their affection.

3. Copy
	- Word choices
		- Are your word choices off putting to your users? Can they be changed to encourage interaction?
	- Use a copy framework
		- When requesting copy, give the request in a way that spells out exactly what you need, how it will be displayed, and what the tone of these words should be.
	- Be mindful
		- Honesty is important
		- Review things
		- Fun, not scary
		- Set expectations
		- Be helpful, not confusing
	- Review your product

Cheap. Delightful. Engaging!
