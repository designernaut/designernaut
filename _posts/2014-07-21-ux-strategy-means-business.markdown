## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2014


### Jared Spool - [@jmspool]

#### 1. What I Really Want to do is Strategy

When the NHL was locked out, two sports reporters from the Montreal Gazette (who otherwise had nothing to write about) decided to play the games on EA Sports NHL, and then write about them as if they were actual games that actually happened. They had the highest views of the paper, ever.

Design is the rendering of intent

Everything we make has **content**
Everything we make has **design**

As organizations, we have separated the group that makes content and the group that designs.

Good UX overlaps the two some.
Great UX overlaps the two completely.

iOS 6 maps had some of the most advanced logic ever, but because they had content issues, they were overlooked.

**Delivering the content is as important as the content itself**

We use *Strategy* to achieve a desired outcome.

UX strategy can't predict outcomes.
UX strategy is broken.

#### 2. Designing Business Models

Amazon Cash Float Model:
- Amazon turns inventory every 20 days (Best Buy turns inventory every 74 days)
- They have 22 days between having received money from their customers for all their products before they have to pay their vendors.

Are business models relevant to non-profits? YES.

What are our business model options?

Business Strategic Priorities (for executives)

- Increase Revenue
- Decrease Costs
- Increase New Business
- Increase Existing Business
- Increase Shareholder Value

#### 3. Advertising is a Business Model Failure

Advertising is all about distracting the user from being able to do what they want to do.

K-Mart "Shipped my Pants" commercial was seen and shared by everyone. But it didn't raise profit by even 1/100th of a percent.

When you don't pay for the product - you *are* the product.

Seducible Moment - the one type of advertising that works

Advertising: corporate centered; broadcast.
Experience: in the moment the user is in.

#### 4. Business Models Beyond Advertising

- Metered paywalls (demands excellent content)
- Repurpose content
- Support Product Sales
- In-App Purchases
- Alternate Channel Revenue
- Content Distribution

#### 5. Delightful Content Adds Real Value

The story sells.

Walmart and [Crutchfield](http://www.crutchfield.com/) sells the same camera. Walmart just copies whatever the manufacturer's description is. Crutchfield creates a compelling story around the item. Crutchfield is intentional and designed.

The best UX strategists create delight by working in the intersection of business and design.

We need to study business models like we study CSS selectors. Know all the options, how they work, and be able to speak the language.
