## Session Notes: An Event Apart D.C. 2014


### Josh Clark - [@globalmoxie]

90% accomplish tasks across multiple screens.
67% start shopping on one device and continue on another.

#### The Gap

Remote control
Text & SMS
Content Syncing (i.e. dropbox)

We're often mid-task. So how do we sync tasks?

##### Behavior Gap

How we move across gaps:
- Sequenced
- Simultaneous

[WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/) - real time communication.

It's not enough to share content across devices. Share action.

Share verbs, not just nouns.

[sonicnet.js](https://github.com/borismus/sonicnet.js/tree/master)

It's part of our responsibility now to help people reconnect with the world. Our screen focused world is both our greatest achievement and fault.

Design for people, not screens.

#### Physical Interaction

[Happy Together](https://github.com/houseoflegend/happytogether)

It's no longer about building a touch interface, a voice interace, a camera interface. Start thinking about the combinations of interactions.

It's not a challenge of technology. It's a challenge of imagination.

**There is magic in the gaps between devices**

The thing with magic is that it deprecates. The magic from 1996 is no longer magical.

Never ever ever ever try to out-mouse the mouse. What is new that can do what a mouse can't do?

#### Physical & Digital

Internet of things

- Digital becomes physical
- Everyday objects are digital gadgets
- Physical things have digital avatars

Social Machines

[Toymail.co](Toymail.co)

Software makes hardware scale

Danger: Everything that can be hacked, will be hacked.

We have to be mindful of the results of these connections.

Software is ideology embedded with values. What is the purpose and meaning of the software we create?

Honor intention. Don't assume it.
<br>
#### Interactions

- Intentional
- Passive
- Social

Amplify our humanity.
<br>
#### Imagination

- Plan for gadget hopping
- Share action
- Peer-to-peer sharing
- Offscreen interactions
- Design for sensors
- Avatars for objects
